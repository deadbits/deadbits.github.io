    Threat intelligence is a must-have for mature organizations, and Splunk is no exception. I focus on researching bad actors and create various ways to mitigate risk to the company, the employees, and customers; whether that's through proactive monitoring, threat hunting, RFIs, intelligence alerts, or any other number of processes.
