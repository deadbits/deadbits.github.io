    Omnibus is a plugin based framework for OSINT (Open-source intelligence) artifact management, collection, and research.
  description: |
    An Omnibus is typically a volume containing several novels or other items previously published separately. That is exactly what this project intends to be for OSINT collection, research, and artifact management.
    With an easy to use interactive command line interface, users are able to create sessions to investigate various artifacts such as IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, user names, file hashes, Bitcoin addresses, and even more as the project continues to grow.
    Since the platform is built in a modular fashion, it is simple to add new functionality and have users create their own custom modules.

    Aleph is a fully asynchronous open-source malware sample dissection pipeline, written in Python 3 and built on top of Celery and RabbitMQ, making it scalable and resilient.
  description: |
    Aleph is made by and for threat intelligence researchers and malware reverse engineers. Using several pre-built collectors (local folder, S3 buckets, IMAP, POP, etc.), Aleph ingests samples that are dispatched to processor workers specific to the file type, then carve out useful information and metadata.
    From there, the extracted data is used in analyzer modules to run intelligence analysis and enrichment on the combined output of all processors.
    All threat and meta data is persisted in Elasticsearch for quick access whether using the web interface or command line. Combined with the RabbitMQ and Celery back-end components, this makes for an incredibly fast, scalable, and reliable automated malware analysis pipeline.
